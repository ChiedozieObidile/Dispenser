# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Smart Contract

## Overview

This project implements a robust Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) smart contract using Clarity, the smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain. The DAO allows stakeholders to create and vote on proposals, manage a shared treasury, and govern the organization through token-based voting.

## Features

1. **Token Management**
   - Governance token representation
   - Token transfers between users
   - Minting new tokens (restricted to the contract)

2. **Proposal System**
   - Creation of proposals by token holders
   - Voting on proposals with token-weighted voting power
   - Automatic vote counting and result determination

3. **Treasury Management**
   - STX deposits into the DAO treasury
   - Execution of passed proposals, including fund transfers

4. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions for various functions
   - Security checks to prevent unauthorized actions

## Smart Contract Functions

### Read-Only Functions

1. `get-balance`: Retrieve the token balance of an account
2. `get-proposal`: Get details of a specific proposal
3. `has-voted`: Check if an account has voted on a specific proposal

### Public Functions

1. `create-proposal`: Create a new proposal
2. `vote`: Cast a vote on an existing proposal
3. `execute-proposal`: Execute a passed proposal
4. `deposit-stx`: Deposit STX into the DAO treasury
5. `mint`: Mint new governance tokens (restricted to contract)
6. `transfer`: Transfer tokens between accounts

## Deployment Guide

To deploy this DAO smart contract:

1. Ensure you have the Stacks CLI installed and configured.
2. Save the contract code in a file named `smartDAO.clar`.
3. Use the Stacks CLI to deploy the contract:

   ```
   stx deploy_contract dao-contract.clar
   ```

4. Note the contract address after successful deployment.

## Usage Guide

### For DAO Administrators

1. **Initial Setup**
   - After deployment, use the `mint` function to distribute initial governance tokens to founding members.

2. **Treasury Management**
   - Use the `deposit-stx` function to add funds to the DAO treasury.

### For DAO Members

1. **Participating in Governance**
   - Create proposals using `create-proposal` function.
   - Vote on proposals using the `vote` function.
   - Execute passed proposals with `execute-proposal` after the voting period.

2. **Managing Tokens**
   - Transfer tokens to other members using the `transfer` function.
   - Check your balance with `get-balance`.

## Security Considerations

- The contract includes various security checks, but a thorough audit is recommended before mainnet deployment.
- Ensure proper key management for administrative functions.
- Regularly monitor proposal activities and treasury balance.

## Testing

To test the contract:

1. Deploy the contract to a Stacks testnet.
2. Use the Stacks CLI or a dApp to interact with the contract functions.
3. Create test proposals, vote with different accounts, and verify correct behavior.
4. Attempt unauthorized actions to ensure security measures are working.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a timelock mechanism for executed proposals.
- Add support for different types of proposals (e.g., text-only proposals).
- Integrate with other DeFi protocols for treasury management.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the DAO contract are welcome. Please submit pull requests with detailed descriptions of changes and ensure all tests pass.
